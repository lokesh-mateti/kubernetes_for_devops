### Kubernetes Basics

1. **What is Kubernetes? Why is it used?**
   - Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It helps in managing containerized applications in various environments, providing scalability, automation, and resilience.

2. **Explain the architecture of Kubernetes.**
   - Kubernetes follows a master-slave architecture:
     - **Master Components**: API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, etcd.
     - **Node Components**: Kubelet, Kube-proxy, Container Runtime.

3. **What are Pods in Kubernetes?**
   - A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, consisting of one or more containers that share network and storage resources.

4. **How does Kubernetes achieve high availability?**
   - Kubernetes achieves high availability through its architecture and features like replicating Pods across multiple nodes, health checks, and automated rescheduling.

5. **Describe the role of Kubelet in Kubernetes.**
   - Kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It ensures containers are running in a Pod, and reports node status to the master.

6. **What is a Node in Kubernetes?**
   - A Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes where containers are deployed. It can be a physical or virtual machine.

7. **How does Kubernetes handle networking between Pods?**
   - Kubernetes assigns each Pod an IP address and manages networking to ensure Pods can communicate with each other across nodes.

8. **What is a Service in Kubernetes? Different types?**
   - A Service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. Types include ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, and ExternalName.

9. **What is the role of etcd in Kubernetes?**
   - etcd is a distributed key-value store used to store Kubernetes cluster data, ensuring consistency and high availability of the cluster state.

### Kubernetes Components

10. **Explain the role of API Server in Kubernetes.**
    - API Server exposes Kubernetes API and serves as the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane. It handles all administrative tasks.

11. **What is the Scheduler and how does it work?**
    - The Scheduler assigns Pods to Nodes based on resource availability and constraints specified. It ensures optimal utilization of cluster resources.

12. **Describe the function of Controller Manager in Kubernetes.**
    - Controller Manager manages controllers that regulate the state of the cluster. Examples include Node Controller, ReplicaSet Controller, and Endpoint Controller.

13. **What is the purpose of Kube-proxy?**
    - Kube-proxy maintains network rules on nodes, enabling communication between Pods and external traffic.

14. **How do Nodes communicate in a Kubernetes cluster?**
    - Nodes communicate via the Kubernetes API Server and through inter-node communication for cluster management tasks.

15. **What is the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) in Kubernetes?**
    - CRI is an interface between Kubernetes and container runtimes (e.g., Docker, containerd), enabling Kubernetes to manage container lifecycle.

### Kubernetes Networking

16. **How does Kubernetes manage container networking?**
    - Kubernetes assigns each Pod an IP address and uses networking plugins like Calico, Flannel, or CNI to manage network connectivity.

17. **What is a Network Policy in Kubernetes? How is it implemented?**
    - Network Policy defines how groups of Pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. It is implemented using rules specified in YAML manifests.

18. **Explain the difference between ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer Service types.**
    - **ClusterIP**: Exposes Service on a cluster-internal IP.
    - **NodePort**: Exposes Service on each Node's IP at a static port.
    - **LoadBalancer**: Exposes Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.

19. **How does DNS work in Kubernetes?**
    - Kubernetes assigns a DNS name to each Service, enabling Pods to discover and communicate with each other using the Service name.

### Kubernetes Deployments and Scaling

20. **What is a Deployment in Kubernetes?**
    - Deployment manages a ReplicaSet to ensure a specified number of Pod replicas are running. It provides declarative updates to Pods.

21. **How do you update a Deployment in Kubernetes?**
    - Update a Deployment by changing the Pod template spec (e.g., updating image version) and applying the changes using `kubectl apply`.

22. **Explain what a Rolling Update is in Kubernetes.**
    - Rolling Update gradually replaces old Pods with new ones, ensuring zero downtime by controlling the rate of change.

23. **How does Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) work?**
    - HPA automatically scales the number of Pods in a Deployment or ReplicaSet based on CPU utilization or other custom metrics.

24. **What is a StatefulSet in Kubernetes?**
    - StatefulSet is used for stateful applications requiring unique identifiers, stable storage, and ordered deployment and scaling.

### Kubernetes Storage and Volumes

25. **Describe Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) in Kubernetes.**
    - PVs are storage resources provisioned in the cluster. PVCs are requests for storage by users, which claim PV resources.

26. **How does Kubernetes handle storage orchestration?**
    - Kubernetes uses Storage Classes to dynamically provision PVs based on storage requirements specified in PVCs.

27. **Explain EmptyDir volume in Kubernetes.**
    - EmptyDir is a temporary volume created when a Pod is assigned to a Node. It exists as long as the Pod exists and is deleted when the Pod is removed.

28. **What is a StorageClass in Kubernetes?**
    - StorageClass defines storage configurations and provisions PVs dynamically based on storage requirements specified in PVCs.

### Kubernetes Security

29. **How does Kubernetes manage authentication and authorization?**
    - Kubernetes uses authentication plugins (e.g., X.509 certificates, bearer tokens) and RBAC for authorization to API resources.

30. **What is RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) in Kubernetes?**
    - RBAC allows administrators to define granular permissions for users and applications accessing Kubernetes resources based on roles and role bindings.

31. **Explain Pod Security Policies (PSP) in Kubernetes.**
    - PSP defines security policies controlling Pod creation and runtime permissions, such as privileged access and volume types allowed.

32. **How can you secure communication between Pods in Kubernetes?**
    - Secure communication using Network Policies to restrict traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
